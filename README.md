# ludev
A AIO monorepo that makes working on ludic easier in GitPod.

UPDATE:
Note that I am working very hard on this, but I don't commit too often, I work more for quality of commits rather than quantity of commits. I understand that keeping backups as commits is important, but I also want to make sure that it's something worth commiting.
